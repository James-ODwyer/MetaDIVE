# Note, I have placed an if else in each of the R scripts to search for the package and download it locally if not present. error is automated again.


4. error in snakemake conda env calling 

Error looks like "  File "/scratch2/odw014/Conda/envs/snakemake7/lib/python3.10/subprocess.py", line 524, in run
    raise CalledProcessError(retcode, process.args,
subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command 'conda env export --name '/scratch2/odw014/Conda/envs/Virsorter2'' returned non-zero exit status 1.
"
The error is caused by a problem in the snakemake python code. The following fixes it. 
# Updated for scratch3 
at location (dependent of where the environment is saved, snamekame is currently in 2 different envs, snakemake7 and diamondS1)

5. Dram is using a mix of the very large databases on the HPC and the smaller more updated ones locally. Every now and then the module for the HPC databases may be updated
 when this happens need to potentially update the data info and reimport the dram config file after editing (

A. check what the files are called
ls /scratch3/projects/datasets_bioref/DRAM_data

B. updated dram file with newest file names. Will only need to do this for the viral hits, the proteins and possibly the uniref sections. All others have non dataed names
/scratch3/odw014/analysis/databases/dram_HPC_databases.txt

C. updated the dram configs in the conda environment. 
DRAM-setup.py import_config --config_loc /scratch3/odw014/analysis/databases/dram_HPC_databases.txt

D. (for me) Figure out how to automatically check if its been updated and then update it
