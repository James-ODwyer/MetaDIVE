1. Running the full pipeline on a single sample will crash at the combined graphs stage as the R scripts use aggregate functions (it is a bad exit but everything that could be analysed was still analysed so the pipeline is 'complete' 
2. Running analyse raws can cause the program to hang indefinitely if there are 10s of millions of reads which are being analysed in blastn (using the Raw reads paramater fixes this)
3. If no contigs are generated from a sample the pipeline crashes for that sample (will require adding if else across ~15 rules to fix if I want to)
